# **Supermarket Sales Prediction and Analysis**
## **Project Overview**
This project focuses on predicting the total sales of a supermarket based on various features such as product category, promotions, store location, and other factors. Additionally, it involves a thorough analysis of sales patterns and trends to derive actionable insights for improving sales strategies.

## **Objectives**
Sales Prediction: Develop a predictive model to forecast supermarket sales based on historical data.
Data Analysis: Explore the sales dataset to understand trends, correlations, and patterns in the data.
Feature Engineering: Identify and create relevant features that contribute to better sales prediction.
Visualization: Generate visualizations to communicate key insights from the data.

## **Dataset Description**
The dataset consists of various columns that capture supermarket sales and factors influencing them. Key features include:

Date: The date of the transaction.
Store ID: The ID of the supermarket store.
Product Category: The type of product sold (e.g., electronics, groceries).
Price: The price of the product sold.
Promotion: Whether the sale was during a promotion period.
Quantity Sold: Number of items sold.
Total Sales: Total amount earned from the sale (dependent variable).
Steps Involved

## **Data Preprocessing:**

Handling missing values and outliers.
Encoding categorical variables (e.g., store, product category).
Feature scaling for numerical columns.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Analyze correlations between features and total sales.
Visualize sales trends over time and by different features (store, category, promotion).
Identify seasonality, trends, and anomalies in sales data.

## **Modeling:**
Train machine learning models (e.g., linear regression, decision trees, random forest) to predict total sales.

## **Results**
The final model achieved an R-squared value of XX% on the test set, indicating a strong correlation between the features and total sales.
Key insights from the data analysis include:
High sales during specific promotions.
Certain product categories show strong seasonal trends.

## **Conclusion**
This project demonstrates the ability to predict supermarket sales using historical data and identify key factors influencing sales performance. By analyzing sales trends and applying machine learning models, businesses can make informed decisions to optimize their sales strategy and improve profitability.
